# My Corner of the Internet
This is the source code for my [website](https://www.mackaysoftware.com).

It is hosted on Github pages 🚀

I use the 🤩[Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)🤩 library which I simply cannot recommend highly enough.

## Roadmap
My site has a three phase roadmap as follows:

- [x] Phase 1: 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started. This means a public version of my CV for recruiters and potential clients.
- [x] Phase 2: 🙌 Blog Life. Add blogging capability where I will share my thoughts on Tech and "Lessons Identified" through hands-on experience.
- [x] Phase 3: 🧠 Knowledge Sharing. This phase drove my choice of framework (see above) I am self-taught 😎 and enjoy studying! So Phase 3 will be where I start to document essential knowledge from the books I read and courses I take that will help others on their self-taught journey 🚙.
